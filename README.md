The TypeScript library that allows you to use the CDS/Xrm WebApi using SDK like types.
Works with cds-gen to create early bound classes.

## Design Goals
- Quicky make calls to the CDS/Xrm WebApi without needing to understand all of the oddities of the request/response objects.

- Allow generation of early-bound types for use in TypeScript Webresource/PCF projects - right from inside VSCode.

- Be unoppinionated about how the types should be created - and use interfaces rather than classes.
